/**
 * Implements an ordered array.
 * 
 * The payoff for using an ordered array comes when we use a binary search. This kind of search is much faster than
 * a linear search, especially for large arrays.
 * The disadvantage is that insertion takes longer because all the data items with a higher key value must be moved up
 * to make room. Deletions are slow in both ordered and unordered arrays because items must be moved down to fill the
 * hole left by the deleted item.
 * 
 * Another problem with arrays is that their size is fixed when they are first created with {@code new}.
 * Usually, when the program first starts, you don’t know exactly how many items will be placed in the array later,
 * so you guess how big it should be. If your guess is too large, you’ll waste memory by having cells in the array
 * that are never filled. If your guess is too small, you’ll overflow the array, causing at best a message to the
 * program’s user, and at worst a program crash.
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of elements in this array. For the ordering to work, these elements must be
 *            {@link java.lang.Comparable} to themselves.
